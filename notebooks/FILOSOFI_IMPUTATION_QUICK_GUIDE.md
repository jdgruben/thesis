# FILOSOFI Missing Values - Quick Reference

## What Was Done

### ✅ Simplified Approach
Instead of complex missing value detection, we used a **straightforward 3-step process**:

1. **Replace suppression codes** ('s', 'c', 'ns', 'nd', etc.) with NaN
2. **Convert French decimals** (comma → period)
3. **Convert to numeric** (pd.to_numeric with error handling)

### ✅ Smart Imputation by IRIS Type

| IRIS Type | Problem | Solution | Result |
|-----------|---------|----------|--------|
| **H (Housing)** | 9 missing in H-type residential | Fill with arrondissement median | ✓ 0 missing |
| **D (Diversified)** | 43 missing (100% of D-type) | Leave as NaN (too varied) | 43 NaN (OK) |
| **A (Activity)** | 76 missing (86% of A-type) | Leave as NaN (no residents) | 76 NaN (OK) |

## Results at a Glance

### FILOSOFI 2017
```
Total: 871 IRIS
Missing before: 1 (Plaisance 25, 14th arr.)
Missing after:  0 ✓ (imputed with arr. median)
```

### FILOSOFI 2021
```
Total: 992 IRIS

Before imputation:
  H: 9/861 missing (1.0%)
  D: 43/43 missing (100%)
  A: 76/88 missing (86.4%)
  TOTAL: 128 missing (12.9%)

After imputation:
  H: 0/861 missing ✓
  D: 43/43 missing (⚠ intentional - left as NaN)
  A: 76/88 missing (⚠ intentional - left as NaN)
  TOTAL: 119 missing → **only D & A types** (expected)
```

## Why This Works

### H (Housing) ✅ Imputed
- Housing IRIS should have income data
- Missing values are suppression errors (too few people)
- Solution: Use neighboring housing areas (same arrondissement) as proxy
- Safe because: Housing in same arr. has similar characteristics

### D (Diversified) & A (Activity) ⚠ NOT Imputed
- **D-type**: Mixed office/retail/residential - income varies wildly within same area
- **A-type**: Factories, warehouses, ports - no residential population (income undefined)
- Solution: Exclude from gentrification analysis (residential focus)
- Safe because: These areas are out-of-scope for residential gentrification study

## Data Quality Assurance

✓ All 861 housing IRIS have complete median income data (for gentrification analysis)
✓ No values removed - only NaN for non-residential areas (by design)
✓ Suppression codes properly identified and handled
✓ French decimal format standardized
✓ Transparent: D and A missing values are expected & documented

## For Your Analysis

**Use these IRIS**: All 861 **H-type** housing IRIS with complete income data
**Exclude**: D-type (mixed) and A-type (activity) zones
**Result**: Clean dataset ready for gentrification analysis

- Shows breakdown of missing values by type
- Confirms imputation completeness for H-type
- Documents intentional NaN for D and A types
