## Key Innovations in V3

### 1. **Enhanced Data Quality** (from V2)
```python
def detect_all_missing_values(df, dataset_name):
    """Detects both NaN and hidden missing codes ('s', 'c', '/', '-')"""
```

### 2. **Spatial Lag Imputation** (from V2)
```python
# For FILOSOFI 2021 (139 missing IRIS)
# Uses OLS regression with spatial neighbors' values
filosofi_2021_imputed = spatial_lag_imputation(
    filosofi_2021, iris_geo, target_vars=['median_uc', 'gini']
)
```

### 3. **Global Moran's I** (NEW)
```python
from esda.moran import Moran
moran = Moran(values, weights, permutations=999)
# Tests if values cluster spatially (autocorrelation)
```

### 4. **Local Moran's I (LISA)** (NEW)
```python
from esda.moran import Moran_Local
lisa = Moran_Local(values, weights, permutations=999)
# Identifies 4 cluster types:
#   HH: High income surrounded by high (affluent clusters)
#   LL: Low income surrounded by low (disadvantaged clusters)
#   HL: High income surrounded by low (gentrification fronts)
#   LH: Low income surrounded by high (pockets of poverty)
```

### 5. **Zero Redundancy**
- No duplicate data loading (V2's loader is superior)
- No redundant `.isna()` calls (V2's function covers all)
- Single comprehensive visualization per concept
- Reusable functions instead of repetitive code
